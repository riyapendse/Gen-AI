Video Frame Blurriness Detection and Clear Video Generation
This script analyzes frames from a video source and categorizes them into two folders: "blur_frames" and "clear_frames". It calculates the Laplacian variance of each frame and decides whether a frame is blurry or clear based on a threshold value. Then, it generates a clear video from the frames categorized as clear.
